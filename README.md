[CS 1101] Lab 10 - UTEP for Dr. Akbar


Objective: The goal of this assignment is to practice objects.
Background: Objects represent real world objects. They have states and behaviors (An object is an instance of a class, where a class is a blueprint that describes the behavior that the object of its type supports).  


Assignment: In this assignment you will create a contact list and display the following:
	> A list that shows the full name of Contacts of the user
Once you display the name of each Contact, you will ask the user to select whose message to view. 
The message will contain the Date and Time it was received, followed by the text message itself.
When the message is revealed, you will ask the user if they would like to view the phone number for that specific Contact. If yes, display the phone number for the chosen Contact object, otherwise continue the program.
Lastly, you will ask the user if they would like to view another message. If yes, repeat this process, otherwise, exit the program.
